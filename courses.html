   C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language,
or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, 
and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, 
and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, 
so it is available on many platforms.</br></br>
C++ was designed with an orientation toward systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, 
efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, 
with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,including desktop applications, video games, 
servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 
with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020.</br></br>
The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. 
The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, 
C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; 
he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.Since 2012, 
C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.

                   Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), 
meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. 
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional 
compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,
particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</br></br>

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. 
The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. 
As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. 
Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used 
by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

                    The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</br></br>

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be 
embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as < img/> and < input/> 
directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as < p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
 Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                    PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development.It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. 
The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,
but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</br></br>

PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. 
On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data – would 
form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed 
to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as 
standalone graphical applications[11] and robotic drone control.PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.</br></br>

The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed 
on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.
